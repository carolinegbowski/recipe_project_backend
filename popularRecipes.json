butter, about 1 minute. I prefer to brown the butter by heating for about 3 minutes on high power until the crackling and popping has subsided, the butter browned and nutty-smelling; being careful not to burn it browning butter tips here. Allow the butter to cool momentarily so you don't scramble the eggs. Add all remaining ingredients to the butter, except for the bread, and whisk until smooth and combined. Add the bread cubes and toss gently to coak. Cover with plastic wrap and place bowl in the refrigerator overnight, or at least two hours so the bread has time to absorb the marinade. Before baking, preheat oven to 350F and line a 9-by-9-inch pan with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray. Transfer bread into baking pan, leaving it fairly loosely piled in the baking pan. Watch any bread corners that are jetting up much higher than the rest of the pieces as they will have a tendency to burn more easily so I push any of them down with a spatula so all pieces are roughly the same height. Scrape out any marinade in the bottom of the bowl and pour that over the bread. Bake for about 30 to 38 minutes, or until golden and browned, the marinade has dried out some, taking care not to overbake as you want this moist and coating does not have to be bone dry on all piece. Serve immediately with a pat of butter, warm maple syrup, a dusting of confectioners' sugar, or vanilla maple butter. Store extra French Toast in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days, reheat gently in the microwave prior to serving. For the Vanilla Maple Butter - In a medium microwave-safe bow, melt the butter, about 1 minute on high power; or brown it by heating for about 3 minutes. To the melted butter, add the maple syrup, and whisk vigorously until combined. Heat for about 30 seconds to warm the mixture and add the vanilla and whisk to combine. Pour over French Toast. Extra syrup may be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"For the French Toast - In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter, about 1 minute.

The onion peels will actually give a nice brown color to the broth. Plus, it's so much easier not having to peel any vegetables. Coarsely slice the carrots and celery. Cut the head of garlic in half. Place all of these vegetables into your stockpot.Cut off the dark green part of the leek and leave it whole. Slice the light part of the leek. Place the leeks into the stockpot. Add the rest of the ingredients - fresh and dry mushrooms, parsley, thyme, black peppercorns and bay leaves.You can omit the mushrooms, of course, but I think they give terrific flavor to the broth, especially the dry mushrooms. It's the famous \"umami\" flavor that all chefs are talking about all the time. It basically means a very hearty, almost meaty flavor.You can use any combination of vegetables in the broth. Here are a few other ideas: Cauliflower, kale, spinach, parsnips, potatoes, zucchini, etc. However, if you want to keep it simple, all you really need for a great vegetable broth is some carrots, celery, onion and garlic. That's it.Another great tip is to save any vegetable scraps while you're cooking. I have a freezer ziplock bag in my freezer all the time and any time I'm chopping celery, I cut off the tops and put them in that bag. Carrots peels, the tops of onions, etc, they all go in there. If you have some carrots that get a little bit soft, just chop them up and put them into that bag. Any time you want to make broth, add all these scraps that are still full of nutrients and flavor and add them to the pot.Fill the stockpot with water all the way to the top, leaving just enough room for the broth to simmer and not boil over.Cover the stockpot with a lid, bring to a boil. (It usually takes about 15 minutes to come to a boil.) Season with salt. I like to keep it light on the salt, since when I'm using the broth in some recipes that require me to reduce the broth, the flavors will concentrate and the broth will be much too salty.Reduce the heat to low and keep the broth simmering for about an hour and a half.

Add the chopped asparagus stalks. Cook for about 4 minutes, then scoop them into a strainer. Run under cold water and transfer to a blender.

Blanch the asparagus spears and peas (if using fresh peas) for no more than one minute.

Add the pearl barley, and toast for about 5 minutes.Add the white wine to the pan, and mix with the wooden spoon until most of the liquid has evaporated.
